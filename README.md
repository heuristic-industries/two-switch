# Two Switch Bypass

A possibly over-engineered and disturbingly affordable system for operating two independent latching buttons in a guitar pedal based around the STM32F030F4Px and [https://embassy.dev](Embassy).

#### Goals

We want two switches, each with:

- "Hold for momentary operation
- Persistent state between power cycles

...and we want it on a budget (ideally under $1 total), with parts readily available for pick and place in small quantities.
